# 1. Weâ€™ve said nothing in this chapter about whether you can pass tuples as arguments to a function. Construct a small Python example to test whether this is possible, and write up your findings.

tup = ("hello","world","!")

def stitch(t):
    s = ""
    for i in t:
        s += i
    return s

print(stitch(tup))

# Yes it is possible for a function to accept a tuple as an argument.

# 2. Is a pair a generalization of a tuple, or is a tuple a generalization of a pair?

# A pair is a generalisation of a tuple because tuples can have more than two items. A 2-tuple could be a pair as it consists of only two items (it is most often used for catersian coordinates)

# 3. Is a pair a kind of tuple, or is a tuple a kind of pair?

# A pair is a kind of tuple.
