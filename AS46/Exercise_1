# 1. Add some new key bindings to the first sample program:

# Pressing keys R, G or B should change tess’ color to Red, Green or Blue.
# Pressing keys + or - should increase or decrease the width of tess’ pen. Ensure that the pen size stays between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
# Handle some other keys to change some attributes of tess, or attributes of the window, or to give her new behaviour that can be controlled from the keyboard.
