# 3. In an earlier chapter we saw two turtle methods, hideturtle and showturtle that can hide or show a turtle. This suggests that we could take a different approach to the traffic lights program. Add to your program above as follows: draw a second housing for another set of traffic lights. Create three separate turtles to represent each of the green, orange and red lights, and position them appropriately within your new housing. As your state changes occur, just make one of the three turtles visible at any time. Once you’ve made the changes, sit back and ponder some deep thoughts: you’ve now got two different ways to use turtles to simulate the traffic lights, and both seem to work. Is one approach somehow preferable to the other? Which one more closely resembles reality — i.e. the traffic lights in your town?

import turtle           # Tess becomes a traffic light.
import time

turtle.setup(400,500)
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.title("Tess becomes a traffic light!")
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
tess = turtle.Turtle()
ora = turtle.Turtle()
red = turtle.Turtle()


def draw_housing():
    """ Draw a nice housing to hold the traffic lights """
    tess.pensize(3)
    tess.color("black", "darkgrey")
    tess.begin_fill()
    tess.forward(80)
    tess.left(90)
    tess.forward(200)
    tess.circle(40, 180)
    tess.forward(200)
    tess.left(90)
    tess.end_fill()


draw_housing()

tess.penup()
# Position tess onto the place where the green light should be
tess.forward(40)
tess.left(90)
tess.forward(50)
# Turn tess into a big green circle
tess.shape("circle")
tess.shapesize(3)

red.forward(40)
red.left(90)
red.forward(190)
# Turn tess into a big green circle
red.shape("circle")
red.shapesize(3)
red.fillcolor("red")

while True:
    red.fillcolor("dark red")
    ora.fillcolor("dark orange")
    tess.fillcolor("green")
    time.sleep(1)
    tess.fillcolor("dark green")
    red.fillcolor("dark red")
    ora.fillcolor("orange")
    time.sleep(1)
    red.fillcolor("red")
    ora.fillcolor("dark orange")
    time.sleep(1)



# 4. Now that you’ve got a traffic light program with different turtles for each light, perhaps the visibility / invisibility trick wasn’t such a great idea. If we watch traffic lights, they turn on and off — but when they’re off they are still there, perhaps just a darker color. Modify the program now so that the lights don’t disappear: they are either on, or off. But when they’re off, they’re still visible.
