#1. Write a program that prints We like Python's turtles! 1000 times.

for i in range(0,1000):
    print("We like Python's turtles!")

#2. Give three attributes of your cellphone object. Give three methods of your cellphone.

#Attributes: A camera, a speaker, a touch screen
#Methods: Alarm setting, capturing pictures, storing images

#3. Write a program that uses a for loop to print

for n in ["January","February","March","Apri","May","June","July","August","September","October","November","December"]:
    print("One of the months of the year is "+str(n)+".")

#4. Suppose our turtle tess is at heading 0 â€” facing east. We execute the statement tess.left(3645). What does tess do, and what is her final heading?

#Tess will turn around in 10 complete anticlockwise circles without changing position and end up facing North East.

#5. Assume you have the assignment xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
    #a. Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line.
    #b. Write a loop that prints each number and its square on a new line.
    #c. Write a loop that adds all the numbers from the list into a variable called total. You should set the total variable to have the value 0 before you start adding them up, and print the value in total after the loop has completed.
    #d. Print the product of all the numbers in the list. (product means all multiplied together)

for xs in [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]:
    print(str(xs))

for xs in [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]:
    print(str(xs**2))

total = 0
for xs in [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]:
    total = xs + total
print(str(total))

multiply = 1
for xs in [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]:
    multiply = xs * multiply
print(str(multiply))

#6. Use for loops to make a turtle draw these regular polygons (regular means all sides the same lengths, all angles the same):
    # An equilateral triangle
    # A square
    # A hexagon (six sides)
    # An octagon (eight sides)

import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
bob = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(0,3):
    bob.forward(100)
    bob.left(120)

for i in range(0,4):
    bob.forward(100)
    bob.left(90)

for i in range(0,6):
    bob.forward(100)
    bob.left(60)

for i in range(0,8):
    bob.forward(100)
    bob.left(45)

wn.mainloop()
