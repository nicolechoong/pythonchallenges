#7. A drunk pirate makes a random turn and then takes 100 steps forward, makes another random turn, takes another 100 steps, turns another random amount, etc. A social science student records the angle of each turn before the next 100 steps are taken. Her experimental data is [160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86]. (Positive angles are counter-clockwise.) Use a turtle to draw the path taken by our drunk friend.

import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
pirate = turtle.Turtle()

direction = 0
for p in [160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86]:
    direction = direction + p
    pirate.left(p)
    pirate.forward(100)

wn.mainloop()

#8. Enhance your program above to also tell us what the drunk pirateâ€™s heading is after he has finished stumbling around. (Assume he begins at heading 0).

print("The drunk pirate's final heading is "+str(direction %360))

#9. If you were going to draw a regular polygon with 18 sides, what angle would you need to turn the turtle at each corner?

# 20
