# 2. Define a new kind of Turtle, TurtleGTX, that comes with some extra features: it can jump forward a given distance, and it has an odometer that keeps track of how far the turtle has travelled since it came off the production line. (The parent class has a number of synonyms like fd, forward, back, backward, and bk: for this exercise, just focus on putting this functionality into the forward method.) Think carefully about how to count the distance if the turtle is asked to move forward by a negative amount. (We would not want to buy a second-hand turtle whose odometer reading was faked because its previous owner drove it backwards around the block too often. Try this in a car near you, and see if the carâ€™s odometer counts up or down when you reverse.)

# 3. After travelling some random distance, your turtle should break down with a flat tyre. After this happens, raise an exception whenever forward is called. Also provide a change_tyre method that can fix the flat.
